    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to display a dual-clock system in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. First, getting the initial time from the user input, and then having three different options to add on seconds, minutes, or hours to the time, and then a fourth option for exiting the program.

    What did you do particularly well?

I personally feel like I handled checking for all instances that the program needed to be checked for all cases to be displayed properly and checking for proper inputs.

    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could be enhanced by reducing the size of the code by combining parts of the code into one function as some parts of the code are mostly repeated, to help with maintaining the code and reducing inconsistencies.

    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the code at the time was getting the display clock shown to the user to properly format and getting that bit of the code to work as intended. There were online forums such as StackExchange to look up similar questions that I had to help with any issues I came across.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Some skills I can take from this project is the resources I used to look up when I had problems to help with future issues as well as ensuring proper testing of the code for debugging and user inputs.

    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure to maintain proper spacing in the code to ensure readability as well as commenting throughout to inform of the certain functions of the sections of code.
